# Objective
The main objective of this project was to create an API to manage clients and the loan payments control system from a fin-tech.

# Problem
The program was made to create and manage the clients and keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments from a fin-tech. It also retrieves the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

# Business Rules
1- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all without missing any payment, you can decrease by 0.02% his tax rate.

2- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed until 3 monthly payments, you can increase by 0.04% his tax rate.

3- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed more than 3 monthly payments or didn't pay all the loan, you need to deny the new one.

# Limitations
Loans are paid back in monthly instalments.

# Endpoints

        “term”: 12,

    }

### Notes

Loan payment formula

r = rate / term
instalment = [r + r / ((1 + r) ^ term - 1)] x amount

#### Example

For repaying a loan of $1000 at 5% interest for 12 months, the equation would be:

instalment = [(0.05 / 12) + (0.05 / 12) / ((1 + (0.05 / 12)) ^ 12 - 1] x 1000
instalment = 85.60
